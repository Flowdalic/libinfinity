<p>This site describes the Infinote protocol as currently implemented by <a href="https://github.com/gobby/libinfinity">libinfinity</a>. It provides real-time collaborative editing of documents with the main focus being on collaborative plain text editing. In the meanwhile there are quite a few solutions out there, but all of them implement a different protocol and thus cannot be used with other tools. Our goal is to provide a flexible yet powerful open framework and clients for various environments that can interoperate with each other.</p>

<p>The following is a very brief introduction to the Infinote architecture. More detailed information will hopefully be available soon.</p>

<p>Infinote can be separated into several hierarchies. At the highest level there is a classical client/server communication layer. Each server can optionally provide a simple IRC-like chat the clients can subscribe to to easily communicate while working on the server. Each server also has a directory of documents, or <em>directory</em> in short. This is a filesystem-like hierarchical tree which a client can explore pretty much the same way a filesystem can be explored. It can contain <em>subdirectories</em> or <em>notes</em>. A subdirectory again can contain more subdirectories or notes. A note is a basically a document on the server which clients can modify at the same time. Currently, there exist implementations for two type of notes: Notes of type <em>InfChat</em> provide a chat similar to the server-global one and notes of type <em>InfText</em> provide plain text editing. The protocol does not make any restriction on what note types there are. If both client and server support a given note type, then they can edit it.</p>

<p>To edit a note, a client first asks to be <em>subscribed</em> to a <em>session</em> corresponding to the note. A session represents the contents of a note. Upon subscription the server sends the document content to the client, a process called synchronization. After synchronization, a client can view others making changes to the document, but it cannot make changes itself. To do so, it needs to join a <em>user</em> into the session. This user can then make changes.</p>

<p>Once a client is subscribed to a session it does not need the server connection anymore if the communication method allows direct communication to the other participants.</p>
